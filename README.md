# Maze-Solver
# Maze Solver (Backtracking)

## Overview
This Java program solves a maze using the **backtracking** algorithm. It finds a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner if one exists.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **DSA (Backtracking, Recursion)**
- **Algorithm Design (Backtracking)**
- **Data Structures (Arrays, Stacks)**

## How It Works
1. The maze is represented as a 2D array where:
   -  represents a valid path.
   -  represents a wall.
2. The program uses recursion and backtracking to find a path from the start to the end.
3. If a solution exists, it prints the path as a matrix.

## Example Maze
1  0  0  0
1  1  0  1
0  1  0  0
1  1  1  1
